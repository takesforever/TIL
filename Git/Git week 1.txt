What is Git?
-A version control system
	What does ‘version control’ mean?
The practice of tracking and managing the changes made to code (What is version control | Atlassian Git Tutorial)

Github
- Distributed source code management tool
-work as a central location for different users(developers)
-not limited to specific location (=remote location)
-can be accessed by everyone

Git init (initializing a new repository)
-creates a new git repository (.git subdirectory)
-used to convert an existing project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository

Push/pull/clone
-to reflect the code file from local to remote ->push
-to fetch the changes made on the working copy from remote to local(refreshing)->pull
-to download a working copy from remote to local->clone

Git add – updates from the working directory to the staging area
-staging area: helps to organize the changes made in the file by function/logics
Git commit – save the file
	-shows who(author), when(date), what(changes)
	

mean you are starting a project on git.
1.	작업내역 단위인 commit에는 어떤 정보가 포함되어 있어야 버전관리를 잘할 수 있을까?
You can divide the commit by its function, and if there is a change make it specific in the title so you can easily find the information you need later.
Author, date of the commit and the change in the project should be included.
Commit ID is used to manage the commits efficiently.
2.	지금까지 우리가 실습은 어떤 순서로 했었지?
Create a folder/files ->create a local repository and do the git initializing(usually the same name as the original folder-> stage the files you would like to commit and commit with the comment ->check the history

원격 repo 사용하기
1.	원격 repo 와 로컬 repo 를 연결해서 내용을 반영하고 싶을 땐 어떤 방법을 써야할까?
First, connect the local and remote repository
Pull from the remote repository -> commit from the local repository -> push back to the remote repository
If there is no local repository, you can clone the remote repository and bring the material wanted. If there is both local and remote repository and you want to connect them, you set the local repository to track the remote repository
2.	원격 repo 와 로컬 repo 는 왜 따로 있을까?
When people have to collaborate on the work, they can simultaneously work on the same project by using the remote repository
3.	push 와 pull 의 개념을 원격 repo와 로컬 repo 를 포함해 그림으로 그려보세요.
